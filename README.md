# Corona-Virus-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis

Covid-19 hit the whole world in the year
2020. This year was a disastrous year when
the world stopped functioning. People were
alert and were using social media platforms
to the fullest.
Twitter saw its users asking for help,
criticizing the governments, providing help
and much more. This sea of emotions and
sentiments could be seen through their
tweets.
In this experiment we will try and build a
classification model which will classify the
sentiments of the tweets.

This challenge asks you to build a
classification model to predict the sentiment
of COVID-19 tweets. These tweets have
been pulled from Twitter and manual
tagging has been done then.
